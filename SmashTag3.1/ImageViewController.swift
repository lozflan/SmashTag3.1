    //4. create image view in code which will have 0 size and trick is to have computed image var which sets the image of the image view and sizes the image view to the size of that image when the image is set 

    var imageView = UIImageView() //size = 0,0,0,0 when created


    //kill 2 birds ie set imageview's image and set image view size. computed var that "stores" its value within the imageView in its setter and also sets the size of the imageView whenever it is set. remember computed var has no storage itself but here acts as gatekeeper for stored imageView var
    fileprivate var image: UIImage? {
        get {
            return imageView.image
        }
        set {

            imageView.image = newValue
            imageView.sizeToFit()

            //also now we know image size we can set the scrollview content size with optional chainging if where outlet not yet connected ie imageurl set from prepareforsegue
